Statistics is often divided into two: descriptive and inferential. Descriptive statistics focuses on describing or summarizing our data in an informative way. It allows us to understand the data without actually reading all of it. 

There are many ways to describe our data. However, it is important to understand some of the terms in statistics that we will be using.

# Samples and Population
The concept of sampling helps us to reduce the amount of data analyzed, while also still being applicable to the general population.

The security agents at the airport are responsible for the security of the airport. To ensure that they keep the highest level of security, every passenger and luggage must be screened and inspected physically by the agents. However, this would be impractical as the number of passengers is very high, thus would take a ludicrous amount of time. Instead of inspecting every single passenger, the agents usually select a random passenger for physical inspection. This way, no individual will be guaranteed an expedited screening and we keep the element of ‘surprise’ in the system.

We usually take a sample randomly (or by the help of a random number generator) known as random sampling. This is a method to ensure that everyone in the population is equally likely to be selected as a sample. It also helps eliminate bias in the selection. We will discuss the various sampling strategies in its own chapter.

Suppose that we want to know the average IELTS score of all 200 students in Venera High School. We select a sample of 20 students that are our close friends and ask them their score. While this may seem alright, the fact that we prefer to sample the closest person to us is against the idea of random sampling (known as sampling bias). We should not assume that everyone in Venera High School has a similar score to our 20 friends.
