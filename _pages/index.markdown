<!-- # A Guide to Statistical Method and Analysis -->
Written especially for future statisticians

## About the Guide
This guide is written by an undergraduate Statistics student, not by an expert. It has not been proofread or verified. The purpose of this guide is to summarize my experience in learning Statistics. It was designed mainly for those who are pursuing a degree in statistics and need a rough idea of statistics. 

## What Can You Expect?
Plenty of cases and examples are available in this guide, along with some theoretical background and key takeaways provided in each chapter. 

I will be using R, Python, Minitab, SPSS, and Excel for most computational work, feel free to use any statistical packages that suit your needs.

We will mostly discuss practical statistical analysis and case-studies. However, if possible, I will also add additional context for those who want to know the background and theoretical work behind each analysis. 

## Read Materials
Many books and papers were referenced. I would strongly suggest you read the following instead if you are looking for more in-depth, expert-written topics in Statistics.

- Ott, R. L. and Longnecker, M. An Introduction to Statistical Methods & Data Analysis.
- Walpole, R. E., et al. Probability & Statistics for Engineers & Scientists.
