# The Concept of Hypothesis
The second type of inference is hypothesis test. It is similar to the previous chapter, in which we will estimate the population parameter. However, instead of solely estimating the parameter value from sample, we will compare it to another pre-determined value.

**Example**\\
Let's say that the existing medication can help patients with extreme fever and reduce their body temperature by an average of $4^{\circ}C$. In a study of new drug type, we are interested to know if the drop in body temperature is greater than $4^{\circ}C$, which may indicate a better solution to existing drugs. That is, we are interested if $\mu > 4^{\circ}C$.

Hypothesis can be thought as an idea that needs to be tested. It could be true, or it could be false. We could claim that new phones are more responsive than older phones. It seems obvious that the newer phones are faster and more energy efficient. However, in any studies, it is important to check and provide proofs to support the initial claim. Statistical analysis teaches us to be skeptical and cautious about any claims. A claim is meaningless if it has not been tested.

In statistical study, we develop two kinds of hypothesis and use the following terms.

- The first hypothesis is called **research hypothesis** or **alternative hypothesis**. In the example above, the research hypothesis is $\mu > 4^{\circ}C$, claiming that the new drug is better at reducing fever than existing drugs. It is the hypothesis of interest, and usually (although not always), we want this claim to be true. It is often the main goal of a research. This is denoted by $H_1$ or $H_a$.
- The second is called **null hypothesis**. It is the exact opposite (negation) of the research hypothesis, denoted by $H_0$. In the example above, the null hypothesis is $\mu \leq 4^{\circ}C$, a claim that the effect of new drug is equal to or worse than the existing drug.
- To test the hypothesis, we compute a statistic from the sample and this is called **test statistic**. In the example above, in order to test if the new drug is better at reducing fever or not, we need to calculate the mean temperature drop of the samples, which is our test statistic.
- Rejection region

Rejecting $H_0$ must be done by a thorough procedure with a respectable degree of certainty.

Not rejecting the $H_0$ does not necessarily mean that the alternative is false. It could be that we simply don't have sufficient evidence to support the alternative. It is related to a fundamental logic of falsification, where we can't affirm a hypothesis, but we can conclusively negate it.
