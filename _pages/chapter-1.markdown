# About Statistics
You may have heard about the mean (average), median, or mode. These are the core concepts of statistics. It is also a way to explain our data in short terms. 

**Statistics is the science of learning from data**. In longer terms, statistics is the science of designing studies or experiments, collecting data, and analyzing data. 

As humans, we often think that some ideas are certain. We know that `5+5 = 10`, the molecular structure of water is `H2O`, and the Earth rotates around the sun every year. 

Let’s say that tomorrow it will be raining. Obviously, we can’t be certain that it will happen due to the variation in the atmosphere. Instead, we say that the probability of rain tomorrow is 50%. In statistics, uncertainty will be our friend as **most things are not predictable**.

Statistics help us deliver better decisions by informing us the likeliness of an event. It also aims to get the most of our data by taking into account the uncertainty and variation.

The list of height of all students in a high school is not just numbers on a table. If we dig deeper, we may find information about each student’s health, their physical characteristics, their age, their gender, and even their emotional condition. This is because taller students are associated with older age, females are more likely to grow faster than males at certain ages, shorter students may be caused by their lack of nutrients, or that students taller than 170cm are more confident during extracurricular.

Of course, these are just ideas that have not been verified. **Statistical methods can help us verify these ideas and deliver a meaningful number that we can assess**, usually in probability. Instead of saying ‘tall students are more confident than short students’, we can say ‘tall students have 10% more chance to be confident during extracurricular than short students’.

# The Process of Learning from Data
Data is everywhere and we have just begun to analyze it. These are the main steps we usually take.

## Problem and Goal Definition
Before we can learn from data, we need to set out a goal and the problem to be solved. This will determine the kind of data we need and the analysis that we need to do. We should keep it clear and reasonable.

## Data Collection
After we define our problems and goals, we set out to collect data. This can be done in many different ways, including surveys, user experiments, or simple observations. Collecting data is not as simple as it seems since some statistical analysis has some ‘restriction’ on the data we use. Also, high quality data will drive better decisions, so it is important that we follow the best practices.

## Data Analysis
The last part is analysis. This is usually done through softwares and can be done very quickly. In fact, we usually don’t even need to understand the math and the theory behind it to carry out the analysis, although it would be much better if we do to ensure that we use the correct method on the correct data.

Most statistical analysis relies on ideal data. In practice, our data is dirty and has errors everywhere. We can still do analysis as long as our data is not very far from ideal. That is why we often make assumptions during the analysis. The assumptions are usually not very strict, and oftentimes we violate these and we acknowledge that the result may be misleading.
